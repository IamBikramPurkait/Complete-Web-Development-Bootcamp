CSS Tutorial- Introduction To CSS
So finally, after completing HTML, we are moving towards the exciting part, i.e. CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to design the website to make it look attractive.

Let us first understand, what is CSS?

CSS gives style to raw HTML
It stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is used to give style to our web pages
CSS is used to make websites responsive
CSS takes the responsibility of design in your websites
CSS includes all the things which can be used to design the raw HTML from colouring the background and texts, to adjust the borders, give padding, etc. Moreover, CSS helps in making websites responsive. Responsive means that the site will behave accordingly to the different screen sizes. For example, if you open a website on a desktop and then on your mobile, you will find the difference between their displays. All the components in a navigation bar will move into a hamburger icon if you open the website on mobile.

We can add styles in the HTML part itself, but I would rather recommend making a new CSS file and then attach it to the HTML part. It is so because it is a professional practice when different developers are working on a single website to keep the skeleton of a website in one file and the styling in another file.

Role of CSS

CSS is a style sheet language that is used to handle the presentation of the web page containing HTML.
It makes our websites beautiful and modern looking.
