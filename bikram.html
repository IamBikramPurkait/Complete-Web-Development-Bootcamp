    <h3>Anchor tags</h3>
    <!-- In the body tag, if you type “a", anchor tag will appear. Just hit the enter key or if you want you can manually write the whole tag.
    Here href is the attribute of anchor tag where you have to write the URL of the website or Link that you want to open. Next, you have to write the Keyword on which you want the user to click so that he will be redirected to the linked website.
    Now, the problem arises here is that as soon as we click on the keyword, the website will open on the same webpage but if in case you want to open the website in a new tab then you have to add a new attribute in the anchor tag I.e. “target". 
    Through this anchor tag, you can also link internal webpages that are locally available in your directory. You just have to use the address of the internal webpages including the file name with its extension.  -->
    <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank"> Clik here to open google</a><br>
    <a href="sample.html" target="_blank">It link with sample.html</a><br>

    <h3>Here show the sample image which is store in this directory</h3>
    <!-- In order to insert an image in a webpage, you have to use the img tag. 
    An img tag generally have two basic attributes “src" and “alt".
    Here “src" is the field where you have to insert the URL or address of the image and the “alt" attribute is a field that will display to users if their browser fails to load the image.
    In the “alt" tag, we generally input a keyword of the image that can define the image in case the user can’t see the image. -->

    <h3>Every time you reload the page here show the random image from unsplash.com </h3>
    <!-- Here a random image will be loaded because this URL stores multiple images and any one of them gets reloaded every time we refresh the webpage.  -->
    <!-- If you want to manipulate the dimensions of the images, you can use the “height" and “width" attribute of img tag. Though it is not recommended to manipulate the dimension using these attributes, we will use CSS to alter the design accordingly. Refer to the illustration below: -->
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" alt="error!" width = "300" height="300"><br>
